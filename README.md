# PostgreSQL-Studies

* Just some exercises and dummy projects that I used while studying SQL and PostgreSQL

* I'm following up [Maximilian Schwarzmuller's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-the-complete-developers-guide-mysql-postgresql/) on SQL. Though it uses both MySQL and PostgreSQL, I'm only learning PostgreSQL, since it's what my college is asking me to learn.

* Basically they're notes from classes and exercises.
